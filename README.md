# TodoProject
This project allows user's of the website to create their own todo list and to track the time
it takes for them to accomplish each task, allowing them to become more productive with their time.
Each task has a start button where the user can click on to indicate the beginning  of the taks. 
When the beginning of the task is signalised, the user is constantly updated on the time it's taking him
or her to accomplish the corresponding task.
