# TodoProject
This project allows users of the website to create their own to-do list and to track the time
it takes for them to accomplish each task, allowing them to become more productive with their time.
Each task has a start button that the user can click on to indicate the beginning  of the task. 
When the beginning of the task is signalized, the user is constantly updated on the time it's taking him
or her to accomplish the corresponding task.
